# IS_Project

This is our study done on Housing Price Prediction Models.

## Purpose of Study

This is a study performed as a way of learning machine learning and applying introductory concepts such as EDA, Data Cleaning,
Preprocessing, Data Visualisation and Model Evaluation to create a prediction based model. This project can also be used as a
solution to a real world problem as determining the factors or how many factors affect the pricing of a house at different areas
in the USA.
